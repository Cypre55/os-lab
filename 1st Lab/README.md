# Instructions for Running the Codes 
## Q1
Run as ./Assgn1\_1a\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh NUMBER or bash Assgn1\_1a\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh NUMBER

## Q2 
Put the code in the directory 1.b.files, it will make the directory 1.b.files.out and the text file 1.b.out.txt in the parent directory of 1.b.files

Run as ./Assgn1\_1b\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh or bash Assgn1\_1b\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh 

## Q3
Put the code in the directory data1c, it will make the directories corresponding to the extensions in data1c

Run as bash Assgn1\_1c\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh 

## Q4 
Put the code in the directory temp, it will make the directory files\_mod in the parent directory of temp

Run as ./Assgn1\_1d\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh or bash Assgn1\_1d\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh 

## Q5
Put the code in the parent directory of JSONData

Two versions of the code are submitted, Assgn1\_1e\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh has the VERBOSE support, while Assgn1\_1ewv\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh doesn't

For VERBOSE run with "-v" flag as ./Assgn1\_1e\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh -v or bash Assgn1\_1e\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh -v

## Q6 
Run as ./Assgn1\_1f\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh FILENAME COLUMN or bash Assgn1\_1f\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh FILENAME COLUMN 

## Q7 
Run as ./Assgn1\_1g\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh FILENAME COLUMN REGEX or bash Assgn1\_1g\_52\_19CS30013\_19CS10045.sh FILENAME COLUMN REGEX
